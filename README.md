# LegisLens - Hackathon Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Legal AI Assistant** is a GenAI-powered tool designed to help Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in India navigate complex legal contracts. It democratizes access to legal expertise by providing instant, easy-to-understand risk analysis and high-quality contract drafting.

### 💡 Problem Statement
SMEs often struggle with:
*   **High Legal Costs:** Hiring lawyers for every contract review is expensive.
*   **Complex Jargon:** Legal language is difficult for non-lawyers to understand.
*   **Hidden Risks:** Unfair clauses (like unilateral termination or unlimited indemnity) often go unnoticed.

### ✅ Solution
Our solution provides:
1.  **AI Risk Analysis:** Instantly scans PDF/DOCX contracts and flags "High Risk" clauses (Red/Orange/Green indicators).
2.  **Multilingual Support:** Understands contracts in English and Indian languages (via translation).
3.  **Automated Drafting:** Generates balanced, "Low Risk" templates for Employment, Rental, and Vendor agreements.
4.  **Negotiation Assistant:** drafts professional emails to negotiate unfair clauses.
